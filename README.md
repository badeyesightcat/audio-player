# audio-player
This is inspired by the series of "Build An Audio Player Using HTML5 &amp; jQuery" which is made by Traversy Media. As soon as I saw the video tutorials, it came to my mind that it would be a good idea if I get that idea and turn it into one using vanilla JavaScript. And I got around to get inspired on the UIs for the audio player. I found a kickass design which is made and owned by "Giga Tamarashvili"
